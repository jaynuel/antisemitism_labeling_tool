https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e1OLH5Iw2U
Pre-reqs
- Have an AWS acct
- Have S3 bucket

1. Navigate to "Settings" -> right top corner

2. Navigate to "Cloud Storage" on the left plane:
- Source Cloud Storage (data import)
- Target Cloud Storage (data export)

3. Click "Source Cloud Storage" -> select S3

4. Retrieve API tokens to access S3 on AWS:
- On AWS Cloud -> navigate to IAM -> navigate to user groups
- Create an user group: s3-sync-group
- Add permissions: "AmazonS3FullAccess"
- Navigate to users -> create user: ls-s3-sync
- Select: "Access Key -Programmmmatic Access -> click "Next:Permissions"
- Add user to group "s3-sync-group" -> click "Next: Tags" -> click "Next: Review" -> click "Create User"
- Retrieve Access key id and secrect access key:
Access Key ID: AKIA44IVHR33AYIJWJDH
Secret Access Key: 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

5. On label studio interface: 
- Copy access key and secret key on the "Add Source Storage"
- Copy bucket name on "Bucket Name"
- To use every data file as input, select "Treat every bucket object as source file"
- Uncheck "Use pre-signed URLs"
- Enter "Storage Name": S3 Tweets
- Enter "Region Name" : us-east-1
- Click "Check Connection": If "Successfully connected!" proceed abd click "Add Storage", otherwise debug

Considerations:

- Before "Sync Storage" -> navigate to bucket permissions
- At the very bottom you will find: "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)" -> enter the following JSON script and click "save":

[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "PUT",
            "POST",
            "HEAD",
            "DELETE"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://localhost:8080"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [
            "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
            "x-amz-request-id",
            "x-amz-id-2"
        ],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
    }
]

6. On label studio: click -> "Sync Storage" -> Synced should retrieve the number of task(s) depending on the files on the S3 bucket
7. Go back to the project -> navigate to "Settings" -> navigate to "Labeling Interface"
